# Dataset Information: COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Database

This project uses the **COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Database**, created by a research team from **Qatar University, University of Dhaka, and collaborators from Pakistan & Malaysia**, in collaboration with medical doctors.

### Dataset Composition (latest update)
- **COVID-19:** 3,616 chest X-rays
- **Normal:** 10,192 chest X-rays
- **Lung Opacity (non-COVID):** 6,012 chest X-rays
- **Viral Pneumonia:** 1,345 chest X-rays

### Sources
- COVID-19 images collected from PadChest, SIRM, GitHub, Kaggle, Eurorad, Figshare, and other repositories.
- Normal and lung opacity images from **RSNA dataset** and Kaggle.
- Pneumonia images from **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** Kaggle dataset.

### Format
- Images are provided in **PNG** format.
- Resolution: **299 × 299 pixels**.

### Objective
This dataset supports **AI-driven COVID-19 detection** research and facilitates reproducible experiments.
